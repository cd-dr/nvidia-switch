# off after the X exits. In order to it work, CONTROLLER_BUS_ID and DEVICE_BUS_ID 
# must be set correctly. IDs can be found by inspecting the output of lshw, or even 
# better, lspci -tvv tree.

  # The GPU is set to be removed at boot time, and only be removed at boot time.
  # Otherwise, powersave is prefered. Two reasons can be given. Fist, A GPU being
  # automatically removed can cause some issues with Nvidia  drivers instalation.
  # That's the why the service turn_off_gpu_at_boot.service must be disabled for
  # new nvidia driver instalation. The second reason is that the system hangs if
  # the GPU is put off after its use. Hence, it can only be totally turned off at boot time.

  # TIP: If it the laptop is not plugged, after gaming, is better to reboot the laptop
  # to save battery, but you are not restricted to it; just better.
